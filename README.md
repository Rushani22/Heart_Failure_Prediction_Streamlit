Title: 
  Heart Failure Prediction using Streamlit
  
Description: 
  This project predicts the likelihood of heart failure based on patient data using machine learning models. The web-based app is built using Streamlit and allows users to input data and receive a prediction.   
Features:
  - Predict heart failure based on patient input data
  - User-friendly interface with interactive widgets
  - Visualization of patient data
  - Real-time prediction using trained machine learning models
